/// Generic IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver state machine.
///
/// This structure represents a typestate based radio driver state machine
/// implementation.
///
/// The implementation is contingent on the `RadioDriverImpl` parameter. The
/// current state machine state is encoded by the `Task` parameter.
///
/// The radio driver state machine is modeled after UML behavior state machine
/// concepts (see UML 2.5.1, section 14.2):
/// - It is a single-region, non-hierarchical state machine (section 14.2.3)
///   with a fixed set of "simple" states (section 14.2.3.4.1) as well as
///   well-defined "external" and "internal" transitions (section 14.2.3.8.1)
///   that have to be implemented by all radio driver implementations.
/// - As each state corresponds to a well-defined abstract radio task, we use
///   the radio task name to designate the state. This doesn't mean that state
///   and task may be equated, see below.
/// - Each state MAY define entry and exit behavior as well as a "do activity",
///   i.e. the actual radio task (section 14.2.3.4.3). The "do activity"
///   finishes with a "completion event" (section 14.2.3.8.3).
/// - The transition from the current radio task to the next is scheduled by a
///   radio task scheduler. The scheduler calls one of the typestate-specific
///   methods on the radio driver state machine. Conceptually this is an event
///   occurrence (section 13.3.3.1) that will be stored ("pooled") by the state
///   machine until it reaches a well-defined ("stable") state configuration at
///   which point the transition to the next state ("state machine step") will
///   be triggered (section 14.2.3.9.1). We use async functions and futures to
///   await stable state configurations and transition completion (section
///   14.2.3.8).
/// - To fully benefit from the performance-oriented, precision-timing design of
///   the driver state machine, schedulers SHOULD typically schedule the next
///   task while the current tasks "do activity" is still ongoing. This allows
///   driver implementations to pre-program transitions in hardware so that they
///   can be executed without CPU interaction and deterministic timing as soon
///   as the current task finishes. In this case the lifetime of the task
///   corresponds exactly to the lifetime of the state.
/// - Nevertheless state machine implementations SHALL be able to deal with late
///   scheduling without introducing data races or other undefined behavior. In
///   this case the state outlives the task.
/// - From a state machine's perspective, transitions between radio states are
///   atomic "steps" in the sense that a transition triggered by some event will
///   be run-to-completion (section 14.2.3.9.1) before a new event can be
///   dispatched. From a wall-clock's perspective the execution time of
///   transitions MAY nevertheless be non-zero (section 14.2.3.8). In real-world
///   radio driver implementations this will typically be the case. We implement
///   this by alternating between distinct objects representing the state
///   machine "in state" and "in transit" (section 14.2.3.1) one consuming the
///   other so that they can never exist concurrently.
/// - Transitions between radio peripheral states may have attached
///   transition-specific "effect" behavior (section 14.2.3.8). This allows
///   driver implementations to execute transition-specific code on top of
///   state-specific code. This is regularly required when pre-programming
///   deterministically timed transitions and is the _raison d'Ãªtre_ of the
///   typestate based radio driver design in the first place.
/// - We extend the UML transition execution model to allow for sophisticated,
///   deterministically-timed execution of transition-related behavior. Drivers
///   MAY define transition-specific behavior in callbacks defined within
///   transition implementations:
///   1. "on_scheduled" behavior: Immediately executes when a transition is
///      scheduled. Not defined in the UML standard but required in practice to
///      pre-program the transition effect or to trigger the subsequent state's
///      entry behavior or do activity.
///   2. "on_task_complete": Executes when the transition is actually triggered
///      (either on "do activity" completion or immediately when the "do
///      activity" already finished). Albeit similar, this does NOT corresponds
///      to UML's notion of a transition effect as it is executed _before_ any
///      state-specific exit behavior.
///   3. "cleanup": Executed after the target state entered or if the transition
///      needs to be rolled back. Not defined in the UML standard but required
///      in practice to clean up any left-overs from prior transition behavior.
///
///   Note that none of these behaviors can be considered equivalent to UML
///   transition effects, they are non-standard extensions specific to our
///   execution model.
/// - All behaviors defined for states and transitions may fail in practice.
///   While the UML standard defines exceptions (section 13.2.3.1) it mentions
///   exceptions during transition execution only briefly (section 14.2.3.9.1)
///   and doesn't explicitly define exception handling. As exceptions may
///   regularly occur during transitions, we implicitly define a "choice"
///   pseudostate (section 14.2.3.5) after each behavior that is executed during
///   a transition.
/// - If one of the transition behaviors signals an error _before_ the target
///   state has entered, the transition will be "rolled back", i.e.
///   conceptually each external transition implies several compound
///   self-transitions with a zero net effect routed through the "failure"
///   branches of the corresponding choice pseudostates placed after each
///   transition behavior. Implementations will have to ensure that all prior
///   effects of the transition will be neutralized before returning an error
///   from a transition-related behavior. See
///   [`CompletedRadioTransition::Rollback`].
/// - A rollback is typically not possible if one of the transition behaviors
///   signals an error _after_ the source state has been left (i.e. the
///   state-specific transition() method has been called). Such exceptions
///   SHALL NOT leave the driver in an undefined state. Implementations SHALL
///   fall back to the off state if the target state cannot be reached, see
///   [`CompletedRadioTransition::Fallback`].
/// - We further extend the UML state machine model by defining a "do activity
///   result", i.e. the radio task MAY produce a result (e.g. a transmission
///   result code or a received radio frame). While the result will typically
///   be available after scheduling a transition and before the next state
///   enters, the framework will NOT wake the CPU immediately when the result
///   becomes available but only after the next state entered:
///   - simplified execution model: The radio scheduler only needs to take
///     action once per task, i.e. it can deal with the result of the previous
///     task and schedule the next task in a single step.
///   - energy efficiency: The CPU only needs to be woken up once. This saves
///     unnecessary CPU startup and shutdown cost e.g. due to async executor
///     overhead.
///   - deterministic timing: Dealing with the result before scheduling the next
///     radio task may risk deterministic execution timing if overstretching the
///     possibly short scheduling window.
///
///   See [`CompletedRadioTransition::Entered`].
///
/// SAFETY: Radio drivers are not synchronized. All its methods SHALL be called
///         from a single scheduler.
